# Movie-Store
Develop console based project on movie store
Initially developed the console based movie store where I used debugger to find the bugs and then fixed the code.
After exploring JUnit, I modify this project and create all my methods as modular(single method perfom single task),
 then for each method first create the test case then modify the method to pass that test.
